- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Khano Phidane!

- ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about software development, particularly in the realms of backend systems and data science, where I enjoy crafting efficient algorithms and building scalable software solutions.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm honing my skills in backend technologies, data science methodologies, and ASP.NET. I'm diving into languages like Python, Java, and C#, alongside frameworks such as Django, Flask, Spring Boot, and ASP.NET MVC for backend development. Additionally, I'm mastering tools like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and Entity Framework for data analysis, machine learning, and database management.
- ðŸ’ž I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that integrate backend development, data science, and ASP.NET. Whether it's architecting robust backend systems, designing intelligent algorithms, or developing dynamic web applications with ASP.NET, count me in for impactful collaborations in this space.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me via email at phidanek@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/khano-phidane-b775a6210/.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that ASP.NET was first released by Microsoft in 2002 as part of the .NET Framework and has since evolved into a powerful web application framework for building dynamic websites and web services?
- Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out for any inquiries or collaboration opportunities!
